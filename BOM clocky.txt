UNNAMED GROUP OF PEOPLE'S UNNAMED CLOCK MODULE

ideas [to be] discussed:

- check if this module exists - has something been missed? can we improve? can we make it as good even? etc.
[think were ok - checked mod grid once, need 2nd onion

people use a Doepfer A-160-2, amplifier like the A-183-3 (weak clock signal), an active buffer (ground issues) or a trigger modifier like the A-162 (slewed or otherwise invalid clock signal), 

- what modules have clock/trig issues? will it fix em? can it be made to fix em if not?
[search muffs/google for modules and units with clock/gate/trig issues; 
go through mod grid identifying things using clocks or gates with same potential issues - look deep!
so far:sq1 slewed clocks, es pulses spikes, marbles when supply voltage stabilizes slowly to its target voltage,
 something that depends on which PSU you use, where your module is located, and how other modules on the bus board behave,
PNW seems to be one that doesnâ€™t like to be slaved, something with Rene?, 
slaved Metropolis often needs a dedicated reset signal that is different from (earlier than) the reset bus all other slaved seqs get, .]

- not mini pots

- leds on other ins n outs to show clock/trig signal present/length?

- what colour leds mean what? should dif colours display dif gate/trig length?

- will it goes as smol as 4-6hp [is this wise? too crammed? ...[def wont fit 4hp!]

- 5v internal generation ok?

- bb needs to see if the delay and length times are a good range

- are the 5v/10v suitable voltages for the output options [are they needed?if so what for?]
[Within the A-100 usually any voltage beyond about +3V is treated as "high" (e.g. +5V, +8V, +10V, +12V will work) 
and will trigger an ADSR or any other module with a Gate or Clock input (e.g. trigger delay, sequencer, clock divider, clock sequencer).]

- from 0 V to +8 V for ADSRs; Trigger, Gate or Clock Signals typical voltage levels of 0/+5 V.

- a database of known clock/gate/trig issues that are due to reset/clock/midi issues, 
i.e. not voltage/spikes/slew/gnd issues to help those who might think they need this module but it wont help, 
can post soltuions given in forums to save people time - that'll make us popular as a rource and goto info source on clocks etc - to go in the back of the manual perhaps?!
